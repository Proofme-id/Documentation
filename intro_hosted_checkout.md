# Hosted checkout

> This is WIP

With Proofme, accepting Identifications is a breeze.
We provide a hosted checkout for simple implementations.

## Basic identification flow

In its simplest form, setting up a **identification** requires only three steps: 
- setting up the request with our API
- sending the customer to our hosted checkout
- processing the webhook we send once the identification is completed.
