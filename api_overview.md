# ProofMe Api: Simple and secure

Use the ProofMe API to integrate online identifications by ProofMe directly into your website or app. ProofMe and your website or app back-end will communicate by sending HTTP requests back and forth.

This page provides an overview of the ProofMe API. The topics in the chapter deal with a number of specific aspects of the API. We recommend to read these topics entirely.

If possible it would be wise to leave communication at this level to our ready-made Clients. This allows you to still be in control without reinventing the wheel.

If you have any questions about integrating our API, please [contact us](https://proofme.id/#contact). We are happy to help!

## The ProofMe REST API

The API implements a Representational state transfer (REST) architecture. Sounds technical, but itâ€™s really quite easy. It mainly breaks down to HTTP-methods `GET`, `PATCH`, `POST` and `DELETE` matching the operations to read, update, create and delete.

REST also implies a nice and clean structure for URLs or endpoints. This means you can reach any part of the ProofMe API on https://api.proofme.id/v1 adding the name of the resource you want to interact with.

## Clients, modules and plugins

Well begun is half done. Save time and build on solid foundations. ProofMe API clients are available for Node.js (More coming soon.).

Of course we will also provide modules and plugins for just about every webshop software out there.
