# Proofme Api: Simple and secure

Use the Proofme API to integrate online identifications by Proofme directly into your website or app. Proofme and your website or app back-end will communicate by sending HTTP requests back and forth. This page provides an overview of the Proofme API. The topics in the chapter deal with a number of specific aspects of the API. We recommend to read these topics entirely.
If possible it would be wise to leave communication at this level to our ready-made Clients. This allows you to still be in control without reinventing the wheel.

If you have any questions about integrating our API, please [contact us](https://proofme.id/#contact). We are happy to help!

## The Proofme REST API

The API implements a Representational state transfer (REST) architecture. Sounds technical, but itâ€™s really quite easy. It mainly breaks down to HTTP-methods `GET`, `PATCH`, `POST` and `DELETE` matching the operations to read, update, create and delete. REST also implies a nice and clean structure for URLs or endpoints. This means you can reach any part of the Proofme API on https://api.proofme.id/v1 adding the name of the resource you want to interact with.

## Clients, modules and plugins

Well begun is half done. Save time and build on solid foundations. Proofme API clients are available for Node.js (More coming soon.).

<!-- Of course we will also provide modules and plugins for just about every webshop software out there. -->
